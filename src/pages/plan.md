      We are proposing to trial a School Street at Earlswood Infant School, closing Ifold Road with temporary barriers at the junction with Emlyn Road and with Althorne Road. A reminder that residents will be able to use their vehicles and if you need a delivery at that time or work to be carried out at your home, access will be given. Weâ€™ve chosen the Infant School as we are limited by our volunteer numbers and as much as we would love to trial at the Junior School too, we feel confident that running one trial to the highest standard will give the greatest possibility of extending it to the Junior site in time.
