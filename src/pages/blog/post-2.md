We read [this report on the BBC website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-56910165) with interest, as it’s always good to see and hear about locations where School Streets are running. 

The head teacher at this Essex  school commented that their traffic problem had been made more difficult due to people having to socially distance when walking.

> "People got very cross because they couldn't cross the road, and couldn't pass one another on the pavements," she said. Parents would "often arrive complaining about inconsiderate behaviour" on the road. The head teacher said: "Hopefully this allows people to have a bit more of a chilled start to the day and we'll have a better day in school because of that."
 
Does that appeal to anyone? It does us! [Read the report for yourself here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-56910165).

### Can you help?

A trial School Street scheme will need volunteers and we would love for you to join us. If you’d like to, please email us to set up an initial video call, which if demand calls for it, could be multiple small group sessions to provide more details of the School Streets trial, and help us to put a timetable together for it. Please drop us a line at [LivingEarlswood@gmail.com](mailto:LivingEarlswood@gmail.com)
