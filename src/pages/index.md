    title: A Safer Earlswood
    subtitle: >-
      Calling all residents and parents of Earlswood: Would you like the streets
      to be quieter and safer during school run times? Would you like your
      children to be able to walk to school independently and safely? What if we
      told you there was a way for both of these things to happen, while still
      being able to use your vehicle at these times, as well as have any
      scheduled deliveries/maintenance workers able to access your road too?
      We’re starting a conversation about bringing School Streets to Earlswood.

    title: What is a school street?
    subtitle: >-
      The School Streets initiative limits through-traffic on roads outside
      school entrances through the use of temporary barriers during school
      opening and closing times. Local residents and businesses are allowed
      access along with essential vehicles.

          Reducing the number of children being driven to school reduces
          particulate air pollution around the school; this improves air quality
          and reduces associated risks of lung and cardiovascular diseases.

          obese and eight in 10 do not achieve the minimum recommended one hours
          a day of physical activity.

          Reducing traffic volumes creates safer school zones. Improving walking
          and cycling routes to school also enhances the safety, connectivity
          and quality of life for the community as a whole.
