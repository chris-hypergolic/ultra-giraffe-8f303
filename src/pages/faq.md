## What is a School Street?

A School Street is a timed road closure at the beginning and the end of the school day designed to improve safety for the children and parents using the school. Depending on the powers afforded to your local authority, a School Street may be enforced by the Police, moveable barriers or bollards, or Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras. In Surrey it will be enforced with moveable barriers and a team of volunteers.

## What is the purpose of a School Street? 

+ To create a safer and more pleasant environment for families arriving at school, while also tackling congestion and reducing risk from motorised vehicles
+ To encourage active travel to and from school
+ To improve air quality in the immediate area outside of the school


## When are the School Street restrictions in force?

Restricted vehicle access would be in place between set times around drop-off and pick-up on weekdays during school term time. A School Street does not operate during school holidays or at weekends.

## What if I'm already parked inside the School Street zone when it comes into operation?

All vehicles already parked in the street before the times of operation would be able to leave when they need to. If your School Street is marshalled, the marshals are able to let you out of the School Street zone.

## Who is exempt from School Streets restrictions?           

Specific arrangements differ between School Streets, but in all cases blue badge holders and emergency vehicles would be able to enter the School Street zone during the closure times. Any additional exemptions are usually agreed during the engagement period in the lead-up to implementation of the School Street. It is also important to remember that School Streets generally operate on a trial basis to begin with, and exemptions would be one aspect of the scheme that would be examined based on feedback during the trial. 

## Iâ€™m a blue badge holder, would I still be able to access the School Street zone?

Yes. Blue badge holders would be able to enter the School Street zone. You would be required to drive at walking pace within the zone to ensure the safety of people within it. 

## I'm a parent or carer, could I drive into the School Street zone?

No. Parents or carers dropping children at school are not able to drive into a School Street zone unless they can show that they are exempt. You would still be able to walk, cycle or scoot to school in a more friendly and safe environment.

## How long do School Streets last?

School Streets are usually implemented on a trial basis, using Experimental or Temporary Traffic Orders. The trial period can be anything from a few weeks to 18-months long. If the trial is judged to be successful based on the results of monitoring and feedback from the school community and local residents, the closure would be likely to be made permanent.
