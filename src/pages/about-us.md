      We’re parents and residents of Earlswood, either with children at the Infants, Juniors or both. We’re a small group of likeminded people who are keen on the idea of our children being safer on their school commute, and feel passionately about the School Streets initiative as a starter towards more active travel with all of the benefits that entails. If you would like to join us we would love to invite you for an initial video call, which if demand calls for it, could be multiple small group sessions to provide more details of the trial, and help us to put a timetable together for it. Please drop us a line at LivingEarlswood@gmail.com
